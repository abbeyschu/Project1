# Project 1 - Recipe Finder

## Description

The goal of this project was to create a recipe search webpage that allows a user to enter a desired meal or beverage into a search input field and view a list of recipes (results). The user can click on a result to either visit the original recipe URL or to display an image and instructions.

## Installation

Visit this link to view the recipe finder: https://abbeyschu.github.io/RecipeSearchProject/

## Instructions

WHEN I select a recipe category (food or drink) and enter a search input (example: lasagna)

THEN I am presented with a list of recipes that meet the search criteria.

WHEN I click on a food recipe

THEN I am directed to a URL with complete instructions

WHEN I click on a drink recipe

THEN I am presented with an image, ingredients, and instructions for that drink

WHEN I search for a new recipe

THEN the previous results are cleared and only the new results are shown
