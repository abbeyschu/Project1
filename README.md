Bootcamp project 1

Introduction
The website app our group created allows a user to enter a desired meal into a search input field, which will return a list of recipes (results) that the user can then click on to display an image of the meal, ingredients, nutritional value, and cooking instructions. 

Instructions
WHEN I enter a type of meal (example: lasagna)

THEN I am presented with a list of recipes for the meal.

WHEN I click on a recipe

THEN I am presented with a list of ingredients, their nutritional values, and cooking instructions.

WHEN I search for a new recipe

THEN my previous searches are saved in the search history.

WHEN I mark a recipe as a favorite/one I want to save

THEN the recipe will be saved in a list I can access.
